Analysis of Reality TV Show Married at First Sight

Objective: Analyze the reality show "Married at First Sight" (MAFS) to determine if the experiment of matching individuals who marry without prior acquaintance is a success or failure.

Data Collection: Kaggle.com was checked to see if existing MAFS data was already gathered. This was done as I have not learned Python. So I do not have the ability to do web scraping at this time. The original dataset was scraped from by roliepoly. I used Wikipedia to bring the dataset up to date.

Data Cleaning: Data cleaning was minimal. I added an “id” column to have an easy primary key when importing to SQL. Once imported into SQL additional data cleaning was done to make “jobs” match, for example "fireman" and "firefighter" were all changed to "firefighter."

Exploratory Analysis: Initial exploratory analysis was performed in Excel.
